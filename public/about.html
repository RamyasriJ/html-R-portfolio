<h1>I'm Ramyasri.J</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm a computer applications student at KL University, and when I'm not coding as a web developer, you can find me exploring my creative side. I love singing, dancing, drawing, painting. I even dabble in video editing and crafting.</p>

<p>Beyond my creative pursuits, I'm a very empathetic person with a sensitive heart. I believe in a win-win mentality, where everyone comes out ahead. Family is incredibly important to me - I come from a close-knit joint family, and the love we share is truly precious.</p>

<p>As an anthophile (lover of flowers!), I adore traveling and being surrounded by nature. I'm always eager to learn new things, whether it's a new skill or a different perspective. I'm excited to see what the future holds!</p>
